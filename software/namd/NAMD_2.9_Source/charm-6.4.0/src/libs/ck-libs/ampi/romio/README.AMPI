Here is a list of modifications and clarifications to the version of 
ROMIO integrated into AMPI:

* Used MPI_Info_* calls from AMPI, and darray calls from ROMIO.
* Set -DHAVE_STATUS_SET_BYTES in configure and configure.in, and 
  add status setting call in adio/common/status_setb.c
* Excluded directories doc, lib, man, and test in the distribution.
  (lib will be generated in the building directory $CHARMDIR/tmp/)
* The final library lib/$ARCH/libmpio.a is copied to 
  $CHARMDIR/lib/libampiromio.a and the user is supposed to link
  with ampiromio at link time.
